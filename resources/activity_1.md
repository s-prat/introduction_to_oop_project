## Exercise 1.1 - Introductory Reading - Modelling

### What is a model?

A model is a representation of reality; a computer model is a representation of reality in computational form. 

For example, scientists use models to predict the impact of Climate Change for a specific part of the world. In video games development, models are the building blocks for a video game i.e. objects. Some examples of objects in video games include the Player object, House object, Bed object etc. These are essentially the 'nouns' of the system.

### Got it, but can you tell me a bit more about abstraction? I keep hearing people talking about it and I'm not sure what it means.

Let's use the example of scientists using models to predict the impact of Climate Change for a specific part of the world.

Since the Earth's climate system is highly-complex and coupled with computational limitations, it's not possible to represent everything in a computer model. Scientists will need to 'abstract' i.e. take the most important features which capture the behaviours they want to represent.

For example, if scientists would like to explore the impact of increasing temperatures on the likelihood of wildfires for a certain region of the world, they may choose not to provide detailed information about the ocean or a specific tree in one location, as this information is not relevant. They may choose to make an assumption to model a number of trees as specific types of tree species across a chosen area of land based on a scale they feel is appropriate for their research e.g. a 5km-by-5km grid of the land surface. They make a trade-off between the detail they need to capture to represent the behaviour of the Earth's system and the computational power they have to hand for modelling.

In Software Engineering, we need to think about the detail we are trying to capture and how we're going to abstract it, i.e. capture the information we need to enable us to represent the behaviours of a given system in code.

### I keep hearing about systems & emergence, can you give me a run down of it?

A system is made up of things called components which work together to make a whole. For example, a bike system is composed of a bike brake, wheels, pedals etc. Each component of the bike doesn't do much by itself, but when you combine the components together, they form a bike. The behaviour and mechanics that form the bike system emerge from the constituent parts. This is called 'emergent behaviour'.

In systems thinking, for a complex system each component within the system doesn't do much on its own, but when you put all those components together unexpected behaviour emerges that were not apparent from examining the individual components one-by-one.
